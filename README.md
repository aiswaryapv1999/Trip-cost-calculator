### Trip Cost Calculator ###
## Project Description

The Trip Cost Calculator is a Python program designed to calculate the total cost of a trip by considering hotel stay, flight destination, rental car duration, and additional spending money. The program performs calculations based on user input using basic Python concepts.

## Objectives
* Calculate hotel cost based on number of nights
* Calculate flight cost based on destination city
* Calculate rental car cost with applicable discounts
* Compute the total trip cost

## Technologies Used
Python 3

## Program Structure
The program is structured using the following functions:
* Ihotel_cost(nights)
* plane_ride_cost(city)
* rental_car_cost(days)
* trip_cost(city, days, spending_money)
## Features
* Calculates hotel cost based on the number of nights stayed
* Determines round-trip flight cost based on the selected city
* Computes car rental cost with applicable discounts
* Allows inclusion of additional spending money in total cost
* Uses modular and easy-to-understand Python functions

## Cost Details
# Hotel Cost
$140 per night

# Flight Cost by City
* Charlotte	183
* Tampa	220
* Pittsburgh	222
* Los Angeles	475
  
# Car Rental Cost
Base rate: $40 per day
# Discounts:
* $50 off for rentals of 7 or more days
* $20 off for rentals of 3 to 6 days
  
## Conclusion
This program demonstrates the use of Python functions and conditional logic to calculate the overall cost of a trip in a structured and efficient manner.
